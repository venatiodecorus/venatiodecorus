## About Me

I've been writing code for 15+ years and fiddling with computers for even longer. I knew I wanted to work with computers since I first laid my hands on the keyboard of my family's Commodore 64. Today I mostly work on the web in Typescript.

## My Career

A brief summary of my career:

- I went to school for and secured my first job working in the games industry. I grew up enjoying video games and still do.
- Pivoted into embedded development, writing control software for devices and subcontracting for the US Navy.
- My next few positions generally revolved around web technologies, from Cold Fusion and ASP.Net to PHP and Javascript.
- Took a detour into legacy systems and worked with COBOL for a bit and got an interesting glimpse into the past.
- Returned to and mostly settled on working on the web, primarly working in Typescript.
